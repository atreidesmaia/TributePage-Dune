Under the main guidelines of this project I've developed a TributePage: Dune.

First of all, I needed the content to work with. I was able to find it here: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune

Then, I design the layout by hand. Eventhough there is a website example, I thought it was handy for me to draw it on a piece of paper.

For the layout and the content organization, there are two versions of the project.
In this project you will find a raw and first approach to webdesign.
